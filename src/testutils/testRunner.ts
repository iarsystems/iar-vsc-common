/**
 * Run a set of tests using the vscode-runtests interface.
 * @param relPath The path from which to resolve the other path parameters (if they are relative).
 * @param extensionPath The path to the extension root, containing the package.json file. This is the extension that will be loaded in the test window.
 * @param testPath The path to the index file to run.
 * @param envVars Environment variables to pass to the test process. Since tests are run in a separate process, this is the easiest way to pass parameters to them.
 * @param workspaceDirectory A directory to open as the workspace when running the tests.
 * @param rootName A custom name for the outermost test suite. Can be used to differentiate between runs of the same test suite with different parameters.
